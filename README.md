#Madlibs
A fun experiment.

#### Install Instructions
Download the folder, go to the root of this folder in a terminal, and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888` locally and then point your browser to `localhost:8888`.

#### TODO
Currently, this is just a front-end single player game. Following are the features I'd like to add very soon:

- Create a webserver that serves the madlib requests
- Multiplayer on the same computer
- True multiplayer using websockets
- Account creation (connect with facebook, or some other social media site)
- Create and store your own madlibs
- Share your madlib on social media and tag the people you created it with
